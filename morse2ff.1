.Nd convert Murdoch Mysteries television show morse format to farbfeld
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op palette
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads the bespoke morse format from standard in, converts it to farbfeld and writes the result to
stdout.
.Pp
This program implements a file format used in one episode of Murdoch Mysteries
television show. Each line has letters/numbers which are converted into morse
code and then the dots and dashes are converted to pixels (ignoring the breaks
between letters); each line of text is a new scanline of the picture. (Only
letters and numbers can be used; punctuations, accented alphabets, etc are not
possible).

The program takes one optional argument being any combination of the following
letters:

   r: Reverse video. If specified, then a dot is white and a dash is black.
      Normally (if not specified), then a dot is black and a dash is white.

The decoder automatically figures out whether or not the input format is
compact, hence the c argument is not required but the tool will not complain
if that argument is passed.
.Pp
In case of an error
.Nm
writes a diagnostic message to stderr.
