.Nm fuun2ff
.Nd convert Fuun RNA description to farbfeld
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
<?width?> <?height?>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads a Fuun RNA description from stdin, converts it to
.Xr farbfeld 5
and writes the result to stdout.
.Pp
Fuun RNA is a graphic description language. It was defined for the task of the
ICFP contest 2007 (“Morph Endo”).
.Pp
The RNA of the extraterrestrial Fuun species (program) is a string of RNA
bases, where a base is one of the following four letters: I, C, F, P. RNA is
normally generated from Fuun DNA. The RNA is always read as a sequence of
chunks of 7 bases each (and the DNA actually writes it in the same 7 chunks).
Every 7 byte chunk encodes an operation, and all the operations of the program
are executed sequentially, without any forms of flow control. There are 21
operations, 20 of which each have a single encoding to chunks, and every other
code is interpreted as a no-op.
.Pp
The output of an RNA program is an 8 bit deep RGB bitmap image of size 600x600
pixels.
.Pp
Optionally the image size can be specified with one or two command line
arguments:
   fuun2ff 800       - will output a bitmap image of size 800x800
   fuun2ff 600 440   - will output a bitmap image of size 600x448

In case of an error
.Nm
writes a diagnostic message to stderr.
