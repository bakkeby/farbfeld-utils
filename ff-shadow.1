.Sh NAME
.Nm ff-shadow
.Nd farbfeld filter that generates shadows
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
<?-options?> <light> <?light?> ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads a
.Xr farbfeld 5
image from stdin, applies the shadow filter and writes the result to stdout.
.Pp
The alpha channel is used as the depth buffer, to tell where are the objects
that the shadows are from.
.Pp
In case of an error
.Nm
writes a diagnostic message to stderr.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It 0
Image processed successfully.
.It 1
An error occurred.

.Sh OPTIONS
The filter takes one or more arguments:
   options - a dash followed by one or more letters to enable options
   light - one or more light sources

The options available are:
   a -- by default the program will make the output picture opaque and darken
        the parts with shadow; with the -a option the shadows are written to
        the alpha channel instead of darkening the picture.

Every following argument is a light. Each light is defined by one or more
light options, which consists of a letter followed by an integer (which may be
positive, zero, or negative), with nothing in between.

Valid light options include:
   b -- block shadow mode;
        - if set to 1, drop shadows are drawn at the correct height for the
          object the shadow is cast on
        - if set to 2, block shadows are drawn for the height of the object
          the shadow is cast on
        (note that this mode is very slow to compute)
   c -- ceiling of shadows, where 65535 is the default setting and draws
        shadows for all objects; lower numbers mean do not draw shadows for
        objects with a higher alpha value than the specified number
   i -- amount of shadow to add when this light is blocked by an object, from
        0 to 65535; the total of all lights must not exceed 65535
        (not valid if b is also set)
   m -- shadow amount when this light is blocked by an object, from 0 to 65535
        Unlike i, these shadows do not accumulate, are allowed to total more
        than 65535, and are valid even if b is set.
   x -- X offset to draw shadows for objects with depth 65535 - may be
        negative for shadows to the left
   y -- Y offset to draw shadows for objects with depth 65535 - may be
        negative for shadows up

As an example a light may be defined by an X offset, an Y offset, and an m
option: x-200y150m48000

A maximum of 32 lights can be specified.
