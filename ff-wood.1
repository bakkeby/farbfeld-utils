.Sh NAME
.Nm ff-wood
.Nd farbfeld filter that use random turbulence data to make wood or marble
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
<mode:dec> <xperiod> <yperiod> <power> <power> <power> <power>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads a
.Xr farbfeld 5
image from stdin, applies the wood filter and writes the result to stdout.
.Pp
This farbfeld filter applies wood or marble using random turbulence data.

The image output is always black and white.
.Pp
In case of an error
.Nm
writes a diagnostic message to stderr.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It 0
Image processed successfully.
.It 1
An error occurred.
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
The filter takes exactly 7 arguments:
   - mode - specifies the algorithm to use
     optionally the mode can be followed by a decimal value that can affect
     the output for modes k and w
   - xperiod - how often to render the pattern on the x-axis
   - yperiod - how often to render the pattern on the y-axis
   - power - multiplier for the red channel on the x-axis
   - power - multiplier for the green channel on the y axis
   - power - multiplier for the blue channel (no effect on modes m and x)
   - power - multiplier for the alpha channel (no effect on modes m and x)

The periods and the multipliers have various effects on the generated output.

The available modes are:
   k -- bars radiating from the center
   m -- bars cutting across the picture (/////)
   w -- rings radiating from the center
   x -- crossed fence (XXXX), may also look like zig-zag (VVVVV)
